# kdec coefficients optimization for comercial sugarcane areas

The Kdec coefficient is computed to mimick the sugarcane yield decrease with sequential cuts (Ratooning).
In experiental areas with low soil compactation, hand-cut canes and better managed crop field the yield decrease (kdec)
with sequential cuts is low. However, the scalability of a satisfatory management (roots health, P&D, compactation and  
harvest) in Brazilian commercial areas impose a huge challenge nowadays. On these areas there is a considerable yield decrease 
with sequencial sugarcane cuts (ratooning). Process-based crop models used to simulate sugarcane yield, such as DSSAT/CAENGRO, 
APSIM-Sugar and FAO-MZA, were not developed to account for these effects on sugarcane yield (roots health, P&D, compactation and harvest)
therefore, a coeffcient (Kdec) is proposed to reduce the simulated yield (i.e. Kdec is the management efficiency of the grower).
